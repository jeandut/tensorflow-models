My poor implementations of a few successful neural networks.  

I extensively used codes from either: 
1. https://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn2  
2. https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon
3. https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.  


Start by downloading CIFAR-10 for python and change the folder data-dir.  

cifar10-allcnn : This is code is me trying to reimplement a [nervana neon implementation](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ModelZoo/tree/master/ImageClassification/CIFAR10/All_CNN) inspired by : [Striving for Simplicity: the All Convolutional Net by Jost Tobias Springenberg, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Thomas Brox and Martin Riedmiller](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6806)
